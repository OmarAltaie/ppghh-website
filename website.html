        The healthcare community faces new challenges and opportunities to improve patient care each year. With the continuing leadership provided by NINR and the support of FNINR, nurse researchers will continue to contribute to the enhanced health and well-being of all Americans, especially in a time when cost-effectiveness and quality of care are equally championed by the public and the Nationâ€™s decision makers.
